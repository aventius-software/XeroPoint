Welcome to XeroPoint (alpha) - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!

I'm pretty much doing this as a technical exercise but its an experimental PHP framework 
based as much as possible on object orientated design ideas, its based on an existing 
framework that I intially developed at home for use with a new website I'm working on but 
which also I use with various work projects.

I'm trying to get passed the use of 'free text' arrays for initialisation and settings such 
as the form controls in the Zend Framework and instead create objects with clearly defined methods 
that can be better managed and extended. Not to mention my pet hate of the fact that 'free text' 
arrays can never be used with code completion or so called 'intellisense' functionality but 
once you have an object - hey presto! That's another way to make things a little painless for 
those of us with dreadfull memories! :-) 

Anyway I'm trying to build this with other interesting features such as easy but powerful and 
dynamic resource management - think content servers and scalability etc...

Hope you enjoy
Ben

P.S. Love it or hate it (I love and hate it in equal measure!! :-) but this has been developed 
using the Zend Studio IDE and with Zend Community Server. You'll probably notice some of the 
ZS project files in this repo, I've left them in for others who use ZS as it should give all 
the required settings (not that there's many) for almost instant 'fun' if you check this out 
as a ZS project.
